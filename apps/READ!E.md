The apps folder is for CP/M programs not tied to a specific version

DU.COM (or DUU.COM)
    
    DU.COM is a utility from Ward Christianson.  It allows direct disk, sector and track
    examination and manipulation.  I found this utility on one of my OSI CP/M disks and 
    it has been useful for dumping out sectors for examination.  I located the help doc 
    DUU.COM in an online repository.  LOok at that file for all the options of DU.COM.
    
ASYNC

    ASYNC and ASCOM were on one of my disks.  THese are serial communicatiosn programs -
    more research is needed.
